# Publication Checklist

Use this only after the folder owner has reviewed the folder and approved the landing page.

## Do Not Publish Until

- The folder owner has read the folder.
- The folder owner has approved the landing page design.
- Premium/VIP eligibility is documented as confirmed.
- A clean Week 5 public repository exists.
- The public repository is not the Week 3 submission repo.
- The final public GitHub URL is ready to paste into `SUBMISSION.md`.
- The final public GitHub URL is rejected if it points at the old Week 3 repository.
- The final public GitHub URL is visible through unauthenticated GitHub API access.

## Final Local Checks

Run these from the working folder before copying the public payload:

```bash
node scripts/verify-submission-copy.mjs
node scripts/verify-submission-surfaces.mjs
node scripts/verify-pitch-reel.mjs
node scripts/verify-reel-page.mjs
node scripts/verify-judge-faq.mjs
node scripts/verify-judge-scorecard.mjs
node scripts/verify-judge-brief.mjs
node scripts/verify-competition-rules-trace.mjs
node scripts/verify-product-thesis.mjs
node scripts/verify-icm-trace.mjs
node scripts/verify-first-run.mjs
node scripts/verify-first-reply-scorecard.mjs
node scripts/verify-start-here.mjs
node scripts/verify-landing-copy.mjs
node scripts/verify-transcript-pack.mjs
node scripts/verify-first-reply-acceptance.mjs
node scripts/verify-console-behavior.mjs
node scripts/verify-eval-coverage.mjs
node scripts/verify-admin-ops-playbooks.mjs
node scripts/verify-whole-person-tour.mjs
node scripts/judge-quick-proof.mjs
node scripts/verify-public-bundle.mjs
NODE_PATH=/path/to/node_modules node scripts/render-review-screenshots.mjs
node scripts/build-public-bundle.mjs
node scripts/verify-clean-public-stage.mjs
node scripts/stage-public-repo.mjs --target ../startline-coach-week5-public
node scripts/final-review-smoke.mjs --expect-blocked
```

Expected before public-link insertion:

- `verify-submission-copy.mjs` reports 2-3 Skool comment sentences.
- `verify-submission-surfaces.mjs` reports the Skool draft, SUBMISSION landing version, and landing-page submission copy are synchronized.
- `verify-pitch-reel.mjs` reports six timed shots, a short voiceover, and zero public-unsafe private/local references.
- `verify-reel-page.mjs` reports six record-ready reel scenes, resolved local refs, and zero public-unsafe private/local references.
- `verify-judge-faq.mjs` reports eight FAQ questions, evidence references, and zero public-unsafe private/local references.
- `verify-judge-scorecard.mjs` reports nine criteria rows, a sequential fast scoring path, and zero public-unsafe private/local references.
- `verify-judge-brief.mjs` reports seven brief sections, evidence references, six fast-test steps, and zero public-unsafe private/local references.
- `verify-competition-rules-trace.mjs` reports 12 brief requirement rows, 4 judging question rows, above-the-brief proof bullets, 4 blockers, and zero public-unsafe private/local references.
- `verify-product-thesis.mjs` reports the folder-first product rationale, whole-person scope, proof logic, and boundaries with zero failures.
- `verify-icm-trace.mjs` reports the public ICM fit map, evidence references, and zero failures.
- `verify-first-run.mjs` reports the cold-start receipt checks and zero failures.
- `verify-first-reply-scorecard.mjs` reports the first-reply pass/fail criteria and evidence links with zero failures.
- `verify-start-here.mjs` reports the 60-second path, first prompt, acceptance test, and proof links with zero failures.
- `verify-landing-copy.mjs` reports the landing launch-kit copy controls and target prompt text with zero failures.
- `verify-transcript-pack.mjs` reports 9 checked cases and zero failures.
- `verify-first-reply-acceptance.mjs` reports 9 checked first replies and zero failures.
- `verify-console-behavior.mjs` reports 9 checked behavior cases and zero failures.
- `verify-eval-coverage.mjs` reports 13 red-face tests, at least 12 research-to-behavior rows, and zero failures.
- `verify-admin-ops-playbooks.mjs` reports 5 admin operations playbooks, 5 close statuses, and zero failures.
- `verify-whole-person-tour.mjs` reports 6 tour stops, 6 prompt blocks, 6 proof checks, 6 immediate-fail checks, and zero failures.
- `judge-quick-proof.mjs` reports `status: "pass"` and summarizes the judge-facing proof counts without requiring the final public GitHub URL.
- `verify-public-bundle.mjs` reports zero failures.
- `render-review-screenshots.mjs` refreshes landing, calendar/inbox admin-band, scorecard, FAQ, proof-gate, submission section, and reel screenshots when Playwright is available through local install or `NODE_PATH`.
- `verify-clean-public-stage.mjs` stages into a temporary separate folder, verifies the staged payload, removes the temporary target, and reports zero failures.
- `final-review-smoke.mjs --expect-blocked` reports `status: "pass"` before the final public link is inserted.
- Warnings about the missing final GitHub link are expected while the folder is still private.

## Public Repo Payload

The generated payload is:

```text
output/public-bundle/startline-coach/
```

Copy that folder into the clean Week 5 public repository after approval.

Or stage it with the guarded helper:

```bash
node scripts/stage-public-repo.mjs --target ../startline-coach-week5-public --write
```

If the target already contains non-git files, the helper stops unless `--force` is passed after review.

From inside the copied public repository, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-public-bundle.mjs
```

It should still report zero failures.

## Insert The Final Link

Dry-run first:

```bash
node scripts/prepare-publication-link.mjs --url https://github.com/OWNER/REPO
```

Write only after the dry-run looks right:

```bash
node scripts/prepare-publication-link.mjs --url https://github.com/OWNER/REPO --write
```

Then run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-publication-ready.mjs
node scripts/verify-github-public-url.mjs
node scripts/final-review-smoke.mjs --expect-ready --skip-build
```

The final green state is:

- `status` is `ready`.
- The GitHub link is the real public Week 5 repository.
- The GitHub link is rejected if it points at the old Week 3 repository.
- The GitHub link is visible through unauthenticated GitHub API access, proving the private review repo is not being submitted by accident.
- The Skool comment draft remains 2-3 sentences.
- Product thesis, Week 5 rules trace, ICM trace, pitch reel, record-ready reel page, judge FAQ, judge scorecard, first-run receipt, first-reply scorecard, start-here path, landing copy controls, transcript pack, first-reply acceptance, and console behavior cases still pass.
- Submission surfaces still match the approved Skool draft.
- The clean-stage preflight has passed from the source folder.
- `final-review-smoke.mjs --expect-ready --skip-build` reports `status: "pass"`.
- No local review notes, generated output, or local provenance paths are in the public bundle.

## Skool Posting Shape

Post the final public GitHub link plus the 2-3 sentence draft from `SUBMISSION.md`.

Do not include local research notes, local browser artifacts, unpublished review-pack files, or unpublished repo history.
