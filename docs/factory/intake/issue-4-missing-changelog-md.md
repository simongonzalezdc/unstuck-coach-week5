## Factory interpretation

This issue was initially picked up by `issue-closer`, but no safe code edit was
produced by the configured agent providers. The Factory converted the issue
into this implementation contract instead of silently skipping it.

The follow-up implementation now adds the requested top-level `CHANGELOG.md`
so the source issue is handled by a repo change, not only by intake tracking.

## Acceptance contract

- Confirm the desired behavior from the issue title and body.
- Identify the smallest implementation slice that can ship independently.
- Add or update tests/proofs for that slice before merging implementation.
- Keep credentials, local machine paths, and deployment secrets out of the repo.
- Close or update the source issue when the implementation PR lands.

## Next Factory action

Verify the PR includes `CHANGELOG.md`, confirm checks are green, and close the
source issue when the implementation lands.
