# Judge Walkthrough

Use this path to evaluate Startline Coach in five minutes.

## 1. Read The Thesis

Open `START_HERE.md`, then `README.md`.

Startline Coach is an external executive-function accessibility layer for whole people when intention, care, context, body state, or closure fail to become action.

It is not an ADHD encyclopedia. It should coach the live moment: state, friction, one next move, held context, and clean closure.

## 2. Check The Required Folder Shape

Required Week 5 files:

- `identity.md`: who the coach is and who it coaches.
- `rules.md`: how it behaves.
- `examples.md`: calibrated interaction examples.
- `reference/`: reusable protocols, signal map, safety boundaries, source notes.
- `README.md`: how a stranger uses it.

Extra proof files:

- `START_HERE.md`
- `PRODUCT_THESIS.md`
- `ICM_TRACE.md`
- `FIRST_RUN.md`
- `FIRST_REPLY_SCORECARD.md`
- `COMPETITION_RULES_TRACE.md`

## 3. Try Four Prompts

Drop the folder into a Claude Project and start with:

Paste `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` into the Claude Project instructions, or use this minimal start prompt:

```text
You are Startline Coach. Read identity.md, rules.md, examples.md, and reference/. Coach me through the life loop in front of me. If my first message is vague, ask one state-calibrating question. If I name a stuck signal, route it directly.
```

Then try:

```text
I need a coach to get started on this.
```

Expected behavior:

- Treats this as a startline moment, not a motivation problem.
- Avoids a plan essay.
- Chooses one visible surface and asks for proof that something is open.

First reply acceptance test:

- Pass: names friction, gives one visible move, asks for tiny proof or one state signal.
- Fail: article, long menu, moralizing, or vague continuation.

Then try:

```text
I need to pay the bill, eat something, and answer the text, but I am frozen.
```

Expected behavior:

- Holds the loops instead of handing them back.
- Recognizes the body-state need.
- Gives one humane visible move and asks for tiny proof.

Try:

```text
My inbox and calendar are a mess and I do not know what is real.
```

Expected behavior:

- Treats this as system overload, not a personal failure.
- Rescues live obligations before cleanup.
- Asks for one hard calendar anchor or one inbox item tied to time, money, safety, or another person.

Try:

```text
idea: make a shutdown checklist for Sunday nights
```

Expected behavior:

- Captures and parks the idea.
- Does not turn capture into a lecture.

Try:

```text
I tried the same plan three times and failed every time.
```

Expected behavior:

- Stops repeating the failed strategy.
- Says the plan failed, not the person.
- Changes task shape.

## 4. Inspect The Proof

Open `landing/index.html`.

The landing page should make the product understandable before you read every file:

- the athlete
- the above-the-brief proof band
- the 60-second cold-run band
- the Claude Project launch kit
- the launch-kit copy controls
- the coaching loop
- the runnable console preview
- the before/after behavior difference
- the folder-method map
- the five-minute judge path
- the record-ready pitch reel page

Use the console to type a stuck point. It should return:

- state
- friction
- first move
- proof check

Open `WRITEUP.md`.

Open `PRODUCT_THESIS.md`.

It should make the design point of view explicit: the folder is the product, first contact is a cold test rather than the whole scope, the coaching loop is staged and inspectable, proof beats persuasion, and the coach stops before therapy, diagnosis, medication advice, or autonomous execution.

Open `ICM_TRACE.md`.

It should make the ICM fit practical rather than decorative: visible context, editable decisions, bounded handoffs, auditable proof, and publication safety should each point to concrete files.

Open `START_HERE.md`.

It should provide the 60-second path, exact Startline Coach start prompt, first-reply acceptance test, and the first cold prompt without requiring the judge to read every file first.

Open `FIRST_RUN.md`.

It should show the exact cold-start prompt, expected first reply, tiny proof loop, and immediate fail patterns.

Open `FIRST_REPLY_SCORECARD.md`.

It should make the first reply scoreable before the judge reads the whole folder: name friction, give one move, hold context, ask for proof, and immediately reject articles, menus, moralizing, vague continuations, or unsafe clinical moves.

It should compress the argument: specific domain, folder methodology, and proof layer.

Open `COMPETITION_RULES_TRACE.md`.

It should map the Week 5 brief, required files, judging questions, and current publication blockers to concrete evidence.

Run its verifier:

```bash
node scripts/verify-competition-rules-trace.mjs
```

It should report 12 brief requirement rows, 4 judging question rows, above-the-brief proof bullets, 4 blockers, and zero public-unsafe private/local references.

Open `HANDOFF_CARD.md`.

It should make the coach handoff obvious enough for a stranger to use without a call.

Open `JUDGE_SCORECARD.md`.

It should make the evaluation criteria explicit enough to score the entry without inventing a rubric.

Run its verifier:

```bash
node scripts/verify-judge-scorecard.mjs
```

It should report nine criteria rows, a sequential fast scoring path, and zero public-unsafe private/local references.

Open `JUDGE_FAQ.md`.

It should answer the predictable Week 5 judging questions quickly: what the coach is, who it coaches, what fails, how it fits ICM, what goes above the brief, and why publication remains blocked until review.

Open `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

It should be paste-ready for Claude Project instructions and should preserve the core loop: state, friction, move, hold, check, close.

Open `PUBLICATION_CHECKLIST.md`.

It should keep final publishing separate from review: design approval, documented Premium/VIP eligibility, clean Week 5 public repo, final link insertion, and the green publication gate.

Open `WALKTHROUGH.md`.

It should make the presentation path obvious: thesis, handoff, demo, transcripts, receipts, verifier, and the five judge prompts.

Open `RECEIPTS.md`.

It should map every public claim to a concrete artifact, so the entry feels inspectable instead of persuasive-only.

Run the verifier:

```bash
node scripts/verify-public-bundle.mjs
```

It should report zero failures, a 2-3 sentence Skool comment draft, and nine console behavior cases. Warnings about the final GitHub link are expected until the public repo URL is inserted.

For the submission-copy proof, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-submission-copy.mjs
```

It should report a 2-3 sentence comment draft under the character cap.

For the submission-surface proof, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-submission-surfaces.mjs
```

It should report that the primary Skool draft, SUBMISSION landing-page version, and landing-page submission section are synchronized.

For the pitch-reel proof, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-pitch-reel.mjs
```

It should report six timed shots, a short voiceover, and zero public-unsafe private/local references.

For the record-ready reel page proof, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-reel-page.mjs
```

It should report six reel scenes, resolved local refs, and zero public-unsafe private/local references.

For the judge FAQ proof, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-judge-faq.mjs
```

It should report eight FAQ questions, evidence references, and zero public-unsafe private/local references.

For the product-thesis proof, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-product-thesis.mjs
```

It should report the thesis sections and evidence references with zero failures.

For the ICM proof, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-icm-trace.mjs
```

It should report the ICM trace sections, evidence references, practical-fit rows, and zero failures.

For the first-reply scorecard proof, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-first-run.mjs
node scripts/verify-first-reply-scorecard.mjs
```

It should report the scorecard checks and table rows with zero failures.

For the console-only behavior proof, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-console-behavior.mjs
node scripts/verify-eval-coverage.mjs
```

It should classify activation friction, a getting-started coach request, communication threat, working-memory overload, idea capture, repeated failed plans, body-first recovery, and calibration fallback. It should also report 13 red-face tests and at least 12 research-to-behavior rows.

For the transcript-pack proof, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-transcript-pack.mjs
```

It should check nine cold-test transcripts and report zero failures.

For the first-reply acceptance proof, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-first-reply-acceptance.mjs
```

It should check all nine transcript first replies for friction naming, one visible move, tiny proof or state signal, and generic-advice failure patterns.

For the one-command proof gate before public-link insertion, run:

```bash
node scripts/final-review-smoke.mjs --expect-blocked
```

It should pass while keeping publication blocked only because the final public GitHub URL is missing and the review placeholder is still present.

For the clean public-repo staging preflight, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-clean-public-stage.mjs
```

It should stage the payload into a temporary separate folder, verify from inside that staged payload, remove the temporary target, and report zero failures.

Build the public repo payload:

```bash
node scripts/build-public-bundle.mjs
```

The generated folder at `output/public-bundle/startline-coach/` should verify from inside itself. That folder is the clean payload for the separate Week 5 public repository after final link approval.

Dry-run clean public repository staging:

```bash
node scripts/stage-public-repo.mjs --target ../startline-coach-week5-public
```

The helper should verify the bundle first and report a dry-run summary. Use `--write` only after the target folder is reviewed.

After the final public GitHub repository exists, dry-run the link insertion:

```bash
node scripts/prepare-publication-link.mjs --url https://github.com/OWNER/REPO
```

Then write the approved URL:

```bash
node scripts/prepare-publication-link.mjs --url https://github.com/OWNER/REPO --write
```

After the final public GitHub link is inserted, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-publication-ready.mjs
```

It should report `status: "ready"`. Before the final link is inserted, it should stay blocked.

Open `demo/before-after.md`.

Look for the difference between generic assistant behavior and coach behavior:

- Generic answer: advice, explanation, motivational language.
- Startline answer: state-aware, one move, working-memory relief, closure.

Open `demo/transcript-pack.md`.

It should give a judge cold-test examples for getting started, whole-life freeze, message threat, overload, raw capture, repeated failed plans, body-first recovery, inbox/calendar reality, and calibration.

Open `evals/red-face-tests.md`.

The red-face tests check whether the coach still works under shame, overload, inbox/calendar reality, capture, tangents, time blindness, repeated failure, hyperfocus crash, and clinical boundary pressure.

Open `evals/research-to-behavior-checklist.md`.

This file shows how the research turned into behavior:

- working memory -> hold the list
- time blindness -> visible anchors
- inbox/calendar noise -> live-obligation rescue
- interoception -> body-first prompts
- system rot -> bankruptcy/reset
- novelty pull -> tangent firewall

## 5. Pass / Fail Criteria

Pass if the coach:

- Coaches a specific domain.
- Responds like a coach, not a knowledge base.
- Uses clean methodology.
- Gives one useful next move.
- Preserves dignity under shame.
- Has a README that makes the folder usable by a stranger.

Fail if it:

- Lectures about productivity.
- Gives a long list when the user cannot start.
- Makes the user repeat context already provided.
- Moralizes avoidance.
- Crosses therapy, diagnosis, crisis, or medication boundaries.
