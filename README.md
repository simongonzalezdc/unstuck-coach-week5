# Unstuck Coach

A folder-based whole-person executive-function accessibility coach for people who need help starting, switching, remembering, regulating, capturing, recovering, and closing loops without shame.

Drop this folder into a Claude Project, Codex workspace, Antigravity-style AI IDE project, or local-model context and ask the coach to help with the life loop in front of you: work, home, body, admin, inbox, calendar, communication, transition, re-entry, or shutdown.

The core idea: Unstuck Coach acts as portable executive-function accessibility. It externalizes state, context, next action, capture, time, transition, and closure so the person does not have to carry all of that internally.

## Who This Is For

Unstuck Coach is for people who already have values, obligations, care, and intelligence, but lose traction at the executive-function layer:

- Too many tasks or life loops in working memory.
- Difficulty starting a known task, chore, message, errand, calendar check, inbox pass, or repair.
- Time estimates that collapse on contact with reality.
- Hyperfocus followed by crash.
- Shame after avoidance.
- Message, conflict, or communication-threat spirals.
- Inbox piles, reply debt, calendar drift, and scheduling friction.
- Unclear re-entry after an interrupted session.
- Raw ideas that need capture without turning into a new planning spiral.
- Body-state needs that must be handled before planning can work.
- End-of-day or transition points that need clean closure.

## What This Coach Does

It helps the user make the next move without turning executive dysfunction into a character flaw.

It does not just answer questions about ADHD, productivity, or motivation. It coaches in the moment:

- Checks state before planning.
- Reduces options to one next action.
- Holds the rest of the list.
- Offers body-doubling scripts.
- Creates re-entry breadcrumbs.
- Uses shame-free return protocols.
- Captures raw ideas without turning them into a lecture.
- Sorts raw brain dumps into one next move plus parked context.
- Uses a bounded dopamine menu when the user needs activation fuel before starting.
- Makes time visible with buffers, hard stops, and start anchors.
- Uses a tangent firewall: chase, bookmark, or discard.
- Switches strategy after repeated failed attempts.
- Resets messy systems without shame.
- Turns calendar and inbox management into small visible passes instead of a demand to process everything.

## Try It Quickly

1. Open `START_HERE.md`.
2. Load the folder into a Claude Project or another AI workspace.
3. Paste `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
4. Try: `I need a coach to get started on this.`
5. Score the first response with `FIRST_REPLY_SCORECARD.md`.

The landing page gives the visual version of this path. The receipts are available when you want to inspect source files, transcripts, or evals.

## How To Use

### Claude Project

1. Create a Claude Project.
2. Add this whole folder as project knowledge.
3. Paste `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` into the Claude Project instructions.
4. Start a chat with:

```text
You are Unstuck Coach. Read identity.md, rules.md, examples.md, and reference/. Coach me through the life loop in front of me. If my first message is vague, ask one state-calibrating question. If I name a stuck signal, route it directly.
```

### Codex

Open the folder as the Codex workspace. `AGENTS.md` is the native coding-agent
entrypoint, so Codex should load the coach contract from the folder before it
answers coaching prompts.

```bash
codex -C unstuck-coach "I need a coach to get started on this."
```

If your coding agent does not automatically read `AGENTS.md`, paste the same
start prompt from the Claude Project path first.

### Antigravity Or Another AI IDE

Create a project from the Unstuck folder. Keep file access scoped to this project, then ask the workspace to read `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `START_HERE.md`, `identity.md`, `rules.md`, `examples.md`, and `reference/` before coaching.

Use the same first chat message from the Claude Project path.

### Local Models

Use a local runner with enough context to hold the operating files. If it cannot ingest the whole folder, paste `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` first, then add:

- `identity.md`
- `rules.md`
- `examples.md`
- `reference/coaching-protocols.md`
- `reference/signal-map.md`
- `reference/safety-boundaries.md`

Then start with one cold prompt from `START_HERE.md`.

## Quick Evaluation Path

This is a shortcut, not the product boundary. Unstuck's scope remains whole-person executive-function accessibility across life loops; this path only makes the first reply easy to test.

Open `START_HERE.md` for the shortest path, `JUDGE_BRIEF.md` for the one-page above-the-brief case, then `landing/index.html` for the visual walkthrough.

Open `FIRST_RUN.md` if you want the exact cold-start receipt before reading the whole folder.

Use the runnable console on the landing page to preview how the protocols turn a messy stuck point into state, friction, one move, and a proof check.

Open `docs/judge-walkthrough.md` for a longer evaluation path.

The quick test:

1. Load the folder into a Claude Project.
2. Try: `I need a coach to get started on this.`
3. Try: `I need to pay the bill, eat something, and answer the text, but I am frozen.`
4. Try: `My inbox and calendar are a mess and I do not know what is real.`
5. Try: `idea: make a shutdown checklist for Sunday nights`
6. Try: `I tried the same plan three times and failed every time.`

If Unstuck gives a productivity article, it failed. If it gives one state-aware next move and closes the loop, it is behaving like a coach.

## Best First Prompts

```text
I cannot start this task.
```

```text
I need a coach to get started on this.
```

```text
I have too many things in my head. Help me sort them.
```

```text
My inbox and calendar are a mess and I do not know what is real.
```

```text
I am coming back after avoiding this project.
```

```text
That message makes me feel like I did something wrong.
```

```text
Body double me through the first visible move.
```

```text
idea: make a shutdown checklist for Sunday nights
```

```text
I tried the same plan three times and it keeps failing.
```

```text
I have 25 minutes before I leave and think I can finish the whole pile.
```

## Verify The Public Bundle

Run:

```bash
node scripts/judge-quick-proof.mjs
node scripts/verify-source-notes.mjs
node scripts/verify-landing-accessibility.mjs
node scripts/verify-mode-router.mjs
node scripts/verify-admin-ops-playbooks.mjs
node scripts/verify-whole-person-tour.mjs
node scripts/verify-judge-brief.mjs
node scripts/verify-public-bundle.mjs
node scripts/verify-final-privacy-scan.mjs
```

The quick proof reports the cold-start path, first-reply gate, transcript evidence, whole-person tour, runnable console, stress evals, admin operations playbooks, source-notes lineage proof, research-to-behavior proof, product thesis, ICM trace, judge FAQ, scorecard, concise judge brief, and fastest cold prompts without requiring the final public GitHub link. The bundle verifier checks required files, local landing-page links/assets, product thesis, source notes, Week 5 rules trace, ICM trace, pitch reel, record-ready reel page, judge FAQ, judge scorecard, judge brief, first-run receipt, first-reply scorecard, start-here prompt readiness, landing accessibility, landing copy controls, mode routing, Skool comment shape, synchronized submission surfaces, transcript completeness, whole-person tour coverage, first-reply acceptance, runnable console behavior, public-safe checklist text, emoji/symbol-range leakage, private provenance patterns, and the standalone final privacy scan. Before final publication it may warn that the GitHub link is still pending; after the public repo link is inserted, those warnings should be gone.

To prove the payload can stage into a separate clean repository folder, run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-clean-public-stage.mjs
```

## Build The Public Repo Payload

Run:

```bash
node scripts/build-public-bundle.mjs
```

This creates an ignored export at `output/public-bundle/unstuck-coach/`. After final link approval, copy that exported folder into the clean Week 5 public repository and run the verifier again from inside the copied repo.

Dry-run staging into a separate clean repository folder:

```bash
node scripts/stage-public-repo.mjs --target ../unstuck-coach-week5-public
```

After reviewing the target, write it:

```bash
node scripts/stage-public-repo.mjs --target ../unstuck-coach-week5-public --write
```

## Final Publication Gate

After final approval and once the public GitHub repository exists, dry-run the link insertion:

```bash
node scripts/prepare-publication-link.mjs --url https://github.com/OWNER/REPO
```

After reviewing the dry-run output, write it:

```bash
node scripts/prepare-publication-link.mjs --url https://github.com/OWNER/REPO --write
```

Then run:

```bash
node scripts/verify-publication-ready.mjs
node scripts/verify-github-public-url.mjs
node scripts/verify-final-privacy-scan.mjs
```

Both checks should report `status: "ready"` after the approved repository URL is inserted. Before that handoff, this gate is expected to report `status: "blocked"`. It should also stay blocked if the link points at the old Week 3 repository or at any repository unauthenticated GitHub API access cannot see.

For one-command final review before the link exists, run:

```bash
node scripts/final-review-smoke.mjs --expect-blocked
```

After the final public link is inserted, run:

```bash
node scripts/final-review-smoke.mjs --expect-ready --skip-build
```

## The Bar

If the coach gives you a long productivity article, it failed.

If it asks one useful question, names the friction without shame, and helps you take one visible next step, it is doing its job.

## Safety Note

This is a coaching scaffold, not medical care or therapy. It does not diagnose, treat, recommend medication, or replace professional support. If a user is in crisis or cannot stay safe, follow `reference/safety-boundaries.md`.
