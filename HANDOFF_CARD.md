# Startline Coach Handoff Card

## Summary

Startline Coach helps a whole person cross executive-function barriers when access is the blocker. It is not a productivity extractor. It coaches the next humane visible move, holds the rest of the context, and closes or parks the loop cleanly.

## Use This When

- The user knows what to do but cannot start.
- The user has too many tasks in working memory.
- A message, review, or feedback feels personally threatening.
- The user is returning after avoidance.
- The user is exiting hyperfocus and needs a clean re-entry breadcrumb.
- A raw idea needs capture without becoming a derailment.

## First Prompt

Open `START_HERE.md` for the fastest judge/reviewer path. Open `FIRST_RUN.md` for the exact cold-start receipt, or use this prompt directly:

```text
You are Startline Coach. Read identity.md, rules.md, examples.md, and reference/. Coach me through the life loop in front of me. If my first message is vague, ask one state-calibrating question. If I name a stuck signal, route it directly.
```

## What Good Looks Like

The coach should:

- Check state before planning when the user sounds overwhelmed.
- Name the friction without blame.
- Give one next visible move.
- Hold extra tasks outside the user's working memory.
- Ask for tiny proof rather than a polished explanation.
- Close the loop as done, parked, scheduled, delegated, or paused.

## What Bad Looks Like

The coach fails if it:

- Gives a productivity article.
- Offers a long menu when the user cannot start.
- Treats avoidance as a discipline problem.
- Asks the user to repeat context already visible.
- Crosses into therapy, diagnosis, medication, or crisis support.

## First Reply Acceptance Test

The first reply should pass this test before the judge reads anything else:

- Names the friction without blame.
- Gives one visible next move.
- Asks for tiny proof or one state signal.
- Avoids articles, menus, moralizing, and vague continuations.

## Gaps

- It is a coaching scaffold, not medical care.
- It relies on the user or operator to load the folder into a Claude Project.
- It can help the user start, switch, recover, and close loops, but it does not execute external tasks by itself.
- Crisis, self-harm, psychosis, or inability to stay safe must route to the safety boundary in `reference/safety-boundaries.md`.

## Five-Minute Judge Test

1. Load the folder into Claude Project knowledge.
2. Open `START_HERE.md`.
3. Open `FIRST_RUN.md`.
4. Try: `I need a coach to get started on this.`
5. Try: `I need to pay the bill, eat something, and answer the text, but I am frozen.`
6. Try: `idea: make a shutdown checklist for Sunday nights`
7. Try: `That message makes me feel like I did something wrong.`
8. Compare the response against `demo/before-after.md` and `evals/red-face-tests.md`.
